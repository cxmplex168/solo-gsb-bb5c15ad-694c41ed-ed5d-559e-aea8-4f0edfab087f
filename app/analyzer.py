"""Core engine: longest-prefix + priority coverage and conflict analysis.

Semantics
---------
Each input rule has:

* ``cidr``      : an IPv4/IPv6 network in CIDR notation (host bits must be
  zero; IPv6 interface scopes like ``fe80::%eth0/128`` are rejected)
* ``action``    : ``permit`` (allow) or ``deny`` (block); aliases accepted
* ``priority``  : integer, **smaller value = higher priority**
* ``source_tag``: free-form label identifying where the rule came from

Forwarding follows classical *longest prefix match* (LPM): the rule with the
longest matching prefix decides the packet.  Priority only breaks ties between
rules that carry the *exact same* CIDR.  This means a long-prefix rule wins
inside its network even when its numeric priority is lower — such a case is
flagged as a ``priority_inversion`` observation, but only when the parent/child
edge is an *effective* action boundary (see the minimal-pair paragraph below):
an edge across which no address actually changes action — e.g. a deny /16
fully covered by permit /17s under a permit /8 — is neither flagged nor
counted, while longer different-action descendants re-forming the boundary
through such a shadowed child keep the inversion.

Coverage of a rule R is
``cidr(R) minus the union of cidr(D) for every winning rule D in R's subtree``.
Winning rules with the same CIDR are grouped into one trie node; among them the
highest-priority rule (smallest number, ties broken by input order) is the
*winner*, the others are *duplicates* and never cover any address space.

A *minimal conflict pair* is generated from every rule N that effectively
forwards at least one address (``effective`` is non-empty): walk up N's
ancestor chain, **skip ancestors whose winning action equals N's action**
(they agree with N, so N changes nothing relative to them), and pair N with
the first ancestor carrying a different action.  The pair's ``override_range``
is exactly N's effective coverage.  Skipping same-action ancestors keeps the
set minimal while never losing a behavioural conflict: a fully shadowed
deny-parent between a deny-child and a permit-grandparent is transparently
jumped over.  The result is deterministic for identical input.
