"""Change-guard: authorize the semantic diff between two saved versions.

A *change guard* replays the effective-action semantic diff of two versions
(:func:`app.diff.diff_analyses`) against a caller-supplied set of
**authorization entries**.  Each entry grants exactly one action transition
on one strict CIDR::

    {"cidr": "10.1.0.0/16", "from_action": "permit", "to_action": "deny"}

``from_action`` / ``to_action`` take the values ``permit`` / ``deny`` /
``none`` (``none`` = no matching rule) and must differ — a grant describes a
*change*, so a transition from an action to itself is meaningless.

An address whose effective action changes between the two versions is
**authorized** only when it falls inside at least one grant of the **same IP
family and the same action transition**; anything else is a violation.  The
grant set itself is normalized geometrically:

* grants of the same (family, transition) may nest or repeat freely — their
  CIDRs are merged into one union (``ipaddress.collapse_addresses``);
* grants of **different** transitions whose CIDRs overlap (one contains the
  other, or they coincide) are rejected as a whole with
  :class:`ChangeGuardError` — the guard never guesses which transition the
  caller meant for the shared range.

Only addresses whose action actually changed need a grant: unchanged space
covered by a grant is not a violation, and grants that match no change are
simply unused.  The response reports ``passed`` plus, per transition, the
**unauthorized** surface as minimal CIDRs with exact address counts.  Like
the diff itself, everything is CIDR geometry — addresses are never
enumerated, so IPv6 ranges (up to 2**128) are handled exactly.
