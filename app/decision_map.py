"""CIDR decision map for a saved analysis version.

Given a *strict* IPv4/IPv6 CIDR query and one already-stored analysis result,
this module answers, for every address in the query:

* the final effective action (``permit`` / ``deny``, or ``None`` when no rule
  matches);
* the winning rule (``rule_id`` / ``source_tag``), i.e. the longest-prefix
  winner node covering the address;
* the full **match chain**: every rule whose CIDR contains the address,
  including losing exact-prefix duplicates and fully shadowed ancestor nodes.

The query range is carved geometrically into pairwise disjoint, jointly
exhaustive *minimal* CIDR blocks of constant decision.  Adjacent blocks with
the same winning rule are collapsed with
``ipaddress.collapse_addresses``; unmatched blocks (``none``) are collapsed
the same way.  Nothing is ever written and the analyzer is never re-run: the
map is derived purely from the version's stored rules and their winning
``effective_cidrs``.

Chain ordering
--------------
Longest prefix first; rules sharing the exact same CIDR are ordered by
priority (smaller number first) and then by original submission order.  When
a block matches at least one rule, the first chain entry is therefore the
winning rule; an unmatched block carries an empty chain.
