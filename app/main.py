    (CIDR, priority) before hashing, so swapping the submission order of
    different-CIDR rules (or of same-CIDR rules with different priorities)
    yields the same hash, while the relative order of same-CIDR same-priority
    rules — the tie-break that decides the winning ``rule_id`` — is preserved
    and still distinguishes fingerprints. Rules submitted without an explicit
    ``rule_id`` are fingerprinted by their generated positional ids.

    successful save of a given ruleset hash creates the immutable version (and
